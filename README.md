# Control of a 4-degree-of-freedom Robot Manipulator with ROS

This project focuses on the control of a robotic arm using the **Robot Operating System (ROS)** on a Linux environment, with the help of **RViz** and **Gazebo**.
The main goal is to develop ROS packages that can control the movement of the robotic arm precisely and reliably using the power and flexibility provided by ROS.


## Project Description
<img align="left" width="200" src="https://github.com/gaetanotorella/HomeWork1/assets/92510009/32803be0-5486-427a-a977-d16d619e0233" />
The robotic arm consists of a series of motorised joints that allow the arm to move in different directions. 
Using **ROS**, **RViz** and **Gazebo**, it is possible to simulate and control the robotic arm in a virtual environment before implementing it on a real hardware system. 
The project includes the implementation of ROS nodes for communication, motor interfacing, sensor management and the implementation of control algorithms.

## Objectives

- Use **ROS** as the main framework for managing the robotic arm.
- Simulate the robotic arm using **Gazebo** to test and validate the control in a virtual environment.
- Use **RViz** to visualise and monitor the status of the robotic arm during operation.
- Implement **ROS** nodes to control the movement of the arm and manage the sensors and camera.
- Optimise control algorithms to ensure fast and reliable response to commands.

## Main Components

- **ROS** (Robot Operating System)
- **Gazebo** (3D robotics simulator)
- **RViz** (3D visualisation tool for ROS)

## Languages and Tools

The project was implemented using mainly **C++** and **Python** within the **ROS** environment. The tools used include **Visual Studio Code** for code development, **Gazebo** for simulation and **RViz** for data visualisation.
